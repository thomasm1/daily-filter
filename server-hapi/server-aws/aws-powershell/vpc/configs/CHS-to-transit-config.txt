! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.

! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
! Association with the IPSec security association is done through the
! "tunnel protection" command.
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0),
! which can be done with the 'network' and 'default-originate' statements.
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.

! To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, copy the 'network' statement
